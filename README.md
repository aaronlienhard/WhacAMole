## What is this project?

A simple whack a mole game created by following [@Kenny Yip Coding's tutorial on YouTube](https://youtu.be/rIQksHTwZzA?si=9-2oUrJybdjCV-s7). I plan on completing the inital tutorial and then adding some extra features based on his ["homework" suggestions](https://github.com/ImKennyYip/whac-a-mole-java). 

## Why do this?

This is practice to get more comfortable with Java programming overall and move closer and closer to a level where I am able to find an entry level developer job.
